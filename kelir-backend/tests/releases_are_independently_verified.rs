//! A release does not tag without a pass that read the work in it
//! ([#392](https://github.com/sujanto-gaws/kelir/issues/392), Sprint 16 item 1).
//!
//! [Sprint plan](../../projects/planning/01.%20Sprint%20Plan.md) §2 has said
//! since 2026-09-04 that the project manager dispatches an independent pass at
//! mid-sprint refinement and that it does not wait to be asked. **It has never
//! once happened on that rule.** Eight sprints, eight failures, and
//! [retrospective 12](../../projects/retrospectives/12.%20Sprint%2014%20Retrospective.md)
//! withdrew permission to restate it a sixth time.
//!
//! `sprint_reports_are_verified.rs` was Sprint 15's answer and it works exactly
//! as designed: a report now either cites a record or says `author-verified`.
//! **What it cannot do is make the pass run**, and it says so in its own module
//! doc. That is not a defect in it — the thing it checks is a record, and the
//! missing thing is an act.
//!
//! # Why this one can
//!
//! **Every control this project keeps enforces an artefact that already
//! exists.** A pass that never runs produces none, so no test of that shape
//! reaches it. This test does not try: it attaches the requirement to something
//! the project cannot skip and already wants — **the tag**.
//!
//! [Sprint plan](../../projects/planning/01.%20Sprint%20Plan.md) §2's last
//! bullet: *every phase ends with a tagged release*. A release is written down
//! as a record in `projects/releases/`, and a record goes `Final` when the
//! release is done. **So the gate is: a `Final` release record cites a
//! verification record, and at least one it cites is new.**
//!
//! The cost is stated rather than hidden: **this fires once per phase, not once
//! per sprint**, which is less than §2 asks for and more than §2 has ever got.
//! §2 is corrected in the same change to say so, because a rule that keeps
//! claiming the per-sprint dispatch would be the ninth restatement.
//!
//! # The three rules
//!
//! 1. **A governed release record cites at least one verification record.**
//! 2. **At least one record it cites is cited by no earlier release.** Rule 1
//!    alone is satisfied by pointing at a pass from three phases ago; this is
//!    what makes each release bring a reading of its own.
//! 3. **The walk finds what exists and governs something**, because a walk over
//!    nothing passes every assertion above it.
//!
//! # The floor, and why it is not the next release
//!
//! [`FIRST_GOVERNED_RELEASE`] is `v0.3.0` rather than `v0.7.0`, and the
//! difference matters: a floor at the next release would govern **zero**
//! existing records, so the test could only ever be red against something
//! planted. At `v0.3.0` it governs four, and they pass — the practice has been
//! real since Sprint 6 and what was missing was the check. `v0.1.0` and
//! `v0.2.0` cite nothing and predate any verification record.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not check
//!
//! **Whether the pass actually ran, or was any good.** Both are
//! `sprint_reports_are_verified.rs`'s limits too, for its reasons: §2's own
//! criterion needs `git log`, which CI checks out at depth 1, and judging a
//! record is what the record is for.
//!
//! **Whether the cited record read *this* release's work.** Rule 2 makes it
//! new, not relevant. Matching a release to the sprints inside it needs a
//! mapping no file carries, and a test that guessed it would fail on the
//! project's real shape — record 09 is *Sprint 11* and record 13 is *Sprint
//! 13*, numbered independently of both releases and sprints.
//!
//! # Seen to fail (coding standard §2.9)
//!
//! Three mutations, run 2026-09-09, all three red — recorded in the pull
//! request that adds this file.
